We're driven by the opportunity to reimagine what it's like to drive and make travel safer, less stressful, and more enjoyable for everyone.



When you join the Latitude team, you'll work alongside leading experts across machine learning and robotics, cloud platforms, mapping, sensors and compute systems, test operations, systems and safety engineering – ***all dedicated to making a real, positive impact on the driving experience for millions of people.***



As a Ford Motor Company subsidiary, we operate independently to develop automated driving technology at the speed of a technology startup. Latitude is headquartered in Pittsburgh with engineering centers in Dearborn, Mich., and Palo Alto, Calif.


**Meet the team:**



The Virtual Test Ecosystem (VTE) team is responsible for implementing the tooling used by Latitude to perform simulations (pure virtual scenarios where we can control interactions and sweep over permutations via a descriptive scenario language) and resimulations (rerunning logs collected on\\-vehicle using an updated version of the autonomy stack). This includes the backend C\\+\\+ simulation/resimulation frameworks that call the underlying autonomy tasks and Python\\-based tooling to run this at large scale in the cloud. This infrastructure enables us to do a large portion of testing before the code ever makes it on vehicle, dramatically reducing autonomy developer iteration time and allowing us to perform large scale safety testing.



We work closely and iteratively with autonomy teams to build out new sim/resim features that they need in order to evaluate their new autonomy features. Similarly, we work hand\\-in\\-hand with the offboard testing teams who are building out test coverage to ensure they can use our tooling to write the tests they need and to get feedback on how we can make this test creation more efficient. And of course we're constantly benchmarking and evaluating the efficiency and scalability of our applications in order to reduce runtimes and cost.


**What you'll do:**


* Add new features needed by autonomy teams and/or testing to the core C\\+\\+ simulation / resimulation framework. This could be a more complex interaction with other actors or some feature of the map. It could also be simulating a new portion of the autonomy stack, or intentionally introducing a degradation to some portion of the stack in order to determine how downstream components react
* Work directly with autonomy and testing teams to understand their needs and pain points, then internally propose features we can add to improve our infrastructure and/or simulation realism
* Support troubleshooting with users and bug fixes when issues are identified; we work with a variety of users on a daily basis
* Analyze simulation/resimulation reproducibility (does running the same code multiple times result in the exact same behavior?) and develop tooling to root\\-cause whether nondeterminism is coming from autonomy tasks or from the simulation/resimulation code
* Learn the autonomy stack at a level of depth that allows you to reason about what the best way is to wire in new autonomy features as they're developed, to be able to do some initial root\\-causing of crashes or issues to isolate what's going wrong (at which point the associated autonomy team would implement the actual fix), and in general to be an effective bridge between our team and the autonomy teams


**What you'll need to succeed:**


* Expertise in modern C\\+\\+ (C\\+\\+17\\)
* Self\\-driven to write code that's efficient, well\\-tested, well\\-documented, and conforms to our style guide
* 3\\+ years' experience with developing software for autonomous vehicles
* 1\\+ years' experience with developing software for some sort of simulation environment
* Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field and 4\\+ years of relevant experience (or Master's degree and 2\\+ years of relevant experience, or PhD)
* Strong communication skills and desire to partner with internal and external team members in order to create solutions that robustly solve the problem and allow us to evaluate the safety and performance of new features


**Nice to have:**


* Python development experience
* AWS or similar cloud experience


**What we offer you:**


* Competitive compensation packages
* High\\-quality individual and family medical, dental, and vision insurance
* Health savings account with available employer match
* Employer\\-matched 401(k) retirement plan with immediate vesting
* Employer\\-paid group term life insurance and the option to elect voluntary life insurance
* Paid parental leave
* Paid medical leave
* Unlimited vacation
* 15 paid holidays
* Complimentary daily lunches, beverages, and snacks for onsite employees
* Pre\\-tax spending accounts for healthcare and dependent care expenses
* Pre\\-tax commuter benefits
* Monthly wellness stipend
* Adoption/Surrogacy support program
* Backup child and elder care program
* Professional development reimbursement
* Employee assistance program
* Discounted programs that include legal services, identity theft protection, pet insurance, and more
* Company and team bonding outlets: employee resource groups, quarterly team activity stipend, and wellness initiatives

Non\\-Exempt new hires accrue up to 16 days of vacation time off each year, at a rate of 4\\.92 hours per pay period. Exempt new hires participate in Cisco’s flexible Vacation Time Off policy, which does not place a defined limit on how much vacation time eligible employees may use, but is subject to availability and some business limitations. All new hires are eligible for Sick Time Off subject to Cisco’s Sick Time Off Policy and will have eighty (80\\) hours of sick time off provided on their hire date and on January 1st of each year thereafter. Up to 80 hours of unused sick time will be carried forward from one calendar year to the next such that the maximum number of sick time hours an employee may have available is 160 hours. Employees in Illinois have a unique time off program designed specifically with local requirements in mind. All employees also have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community.


Employees on sales plans earn performance\\-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non\\-quota components. For quota\\-based incentive pay, Cisco typically pays as follows:


.75% of incentive target for each 1% of revenue attainment up to 50% of quota;


1\\.5% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 50% and 75%;


1% of incentive target for each 1% of attainment between 75% and 100%; and once performance exceeds 100% attainment, incentive rates are at or above 1% for each 1% of attainment with no cap on incentive compensation.


For non\\-quota\\-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.","","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Cisco","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/b799172fd63cfb12d47f7d0f8f79a90b","http://www.cisco.com","San Jose, CA","10,000+","more than $10B (USD)","Cisco wants you to bring your uniqueness, join teams to solve challenges, and work together to build an inclusive future for all with our technology.

* You give and receive direct feedback with grace and professionalism
* You can clearly explain complex technical concepts to non\\-technical stakeholders
* You're comfortable leading discussions and driving decisions
* You naturally build trust through transparency and reliable execution


**Mission Alignment**
* You're drawn to meaningful work that impacts families' lives
* You understand that sustained high performance requires maintaining personal wellbeing
* You're excited about joining a team that values both ambitious goals and sustainable pace
* You're genuinely interested in transforming how families prepare for long\\-term care


 The Ideal Background
   

  

 While we value potential over experience, you likely have:
   

  

* Demonstrated ability to own and deliver full\\-stack projects end\\-to\\-end
* Experience with modern web development frameworks and cloud architecture
* Track record of improving team efficiency through automation and process innovation
* History of taking initiative and driving results without extensive oversight


 We're not looking for someone who's done it all before we're looking for someone who has the raw talent and drive to help us pioneer new approaches to software development and team collaboration. If you're excited about pushing boundaries, learning rapidly, and making a real difference in people's lives, we want to talk to you.
   

  

**About The Role**
 You will be tasked with owning and scaling mission\\-critical features across the entire software stack. The goal will be to push beyond industry best\\-practices in software development by innovating new strategies that leverage LLMs and offshore teams to achieve company\\-defining results for a fraction of the time and cost of what other companies have previously achieved.
   

  

 You will be working with our founding US\\-based team and report directly to our co\\-founder and COO, Evan Ehrenberg, and you will grow to work with and support the management of a team of 40\\+ in the Philippines. You will collaborate on new ideas and implement quickly to test and iterate. Many ideas will not work and will be thrown away. Many ideas will need to be imperfect so that we can implement them faster. Everything will be iterative, no challenge will be too ambitious.
   

  

 You will be challenged to produce meaningful results every week. It will likely take you more than 40 hours per week to drive industry\\-leading results. We do not think that 80 hour weeks are sustainable or effective in the long run, and so while there may be incredibly important times where we mutually decide to be opportunistic to push ourselves to that amount of work to accomplish something very time sensitive, we expect you to generally limit yourself to 50\\-60 hour work\\-weeks. If you want to push harder we will urge you to reflect on ways to be more effective with your time so that you can dedicate your remaining time to benefit your mental and physical health.
   

  

 We will be in the trenches with you, and together we will create one of the most impactful companies that will help families prepare for what has historically been one of the most devastating times in their lives so that they can face long\\-term care with confidence and calm.

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays \\& Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML\\-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product in a high quality way. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s offering.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
* Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to deliver product features on time
* Stay up\\-to\\-date with the latest AI technologies and trends


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 3\\+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre\\-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
* Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
* Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross\\-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
* Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross\\-functionally to accomplish shared goals.


**Nice To Haves**
* You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
* You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
* You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

 We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.
   

  

 We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.
   

  

 Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays \\& Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).
   

  

**About The Role**
 We are looking for an AI Product Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an AI\\-powered product. As an AI Product Engineer, you will work on developing and implementing AI\\-powered products, incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product.
   

  

**What You’ll Achieve**
* Work with the team to prototype and experiment with new AI features
* Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
* Collaborate with cross\\-functional teams to deliver product features on time
* Stay up\\-to\\-date with the latest AI technologies and trends


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* Expertise building and prototyping: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings and other ML technologies. You understand how parts of a system fit together from UI to data model, are familiar with relational databases like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
* Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React.
* Problem\\-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
* Empathetic communication and collaboration: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross\\-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
* Impact\\-orientation and user focus: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross\\-functionally to accomplish shared goals.


**Nice To Haves**
* You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
* You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.


 We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.
